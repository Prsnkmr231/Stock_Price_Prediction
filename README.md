# Stock Price Prediction using Stacked LSTM RNN

### steps:

1.Importing all the required libraries.

2.Load and preprocess the Dataframe.

3.Splitting the dataset on time due to time series data.

4.Applying minmaxscaler to make the scale of the data in the feature range (0,1)

5.Creating the train and test datasets with Features.

6.Building the model with LSTM and Dense layers.

7.Training the model with 100 epochs

8.Predicting on the test_data
